This program is supposed to display the product of n multiplied by n - 1. Find the logic and syntax errors. 

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int n;

   
    cout << "Enter a positive integer: "
    cin >> n;

    
    int result = n * (n + 1);  

    cout << "The product of " << n << " and " << n - 1 << " is: " << result << :endl;

    return 0;
}
