## OER Chapter 4

## Objectives
Upon completion of this unit, students will be able to:
1. Identify the need for repetition control structures
2. Distinguish the use of While loops including For, Do, EOF
3. Write If and Else statements
4. Test break and continue statements
5. Build nested control structures
6. Identify methods to prevent bugs and debug loops

## Introduction

## A Section Per Topic

## Review Questions
1. Which of the following loops checks the condition after the code is executed once?
A.) For Loop
B.) Do-While Loop
C.) Flag-Controlled Loop
D.) Sentinel-Controlled Loop

2. To leave a loop or switch statement, you use _____.

3. True/False: In a for loop, if the initial condition is not met, then the loop body will not be executed,

Answers 1. A 2 Break 3. True
## Summary
- A while loop is structured with the condition before the statement, and the statement will not be executed unless the condition is met
- A do-while loop is structured by the statement before the condition and therefore, the statement will run once no matter what and then will check the condition to see whether it will run again.
- A counter-controlled Loop is a while loop that specifies a specific number, and the loop will count until it reaches the specified number
- A sentinel-controlled loop is a type of while loop that specifies a specific number, and the loop will count until it reaches the specified number
- A flag-controlled loop is a while loop that is controlled by a boolean variable, and the loop ends when the boolean is no longer true
- An EOF-controlled loop is a while loop that checks if the end of the file has been reached and while run until it is reached
- 
## Key Terms
Counter-Controlled Loop
    : Specifies a specific number and the loop will count until it reaches the specified number
Sentinel
    : A special value assigned to end a while loop when it is encountered
Flag controlled loop
    : A while loop controlled by a boolean variable, and the loop ends when the boolean is no longer true
